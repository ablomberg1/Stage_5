        <h2 class="concept-title">Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
        <!--http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML-->
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>HTML <em>hyper text markup language</em> is a computer language used to create web pages on the Internet.  The Internet uses HTTP to transmit data to and from servers.  HTML is the heart of the web and includes documents is made up of text content (what you see), markup (what content looks like), references to images and videos, other documents and links to other pages.</p><p>HTML is made up of elements.  An element consists of &lt;opening tags&gt; content and &lt;closing tags&gt;. Remember, computers are not stupid they are sensitive.  Computers do exactly as the computer programmers tell them.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">HTML Attributes</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>HTML Attributes are within a tag and a tag may have multiple attributes &lt;tag attr="value"&gt;contents&lt;/tag&gt;.  The attribute &lt;a&gt; is an anchor tag. Anchors are for making links. href is an attribute that indictates the URL being linked. Example &lt;a href=”www.reddit.com”&gt; derp&lt;/a&gt; creates <a href=”www.reddit.com”> derp</a> on the web page.  Selecting the link sends the user to the url www.reddit.com.</p><p>Another attribute is &lt;img&gt; which is used for including images, example: &lt;img svc=”url” alt=”text”&gt;.  The alt=”text” piece is required for broken requests.  The alt attribute is also there for those who are blind.  Example: <img src=http://www.udacity.com/cs2e53x/hipmunk.png alt="hipmonk!">.  The img attribute does not require a closing tag because it has no content.</p>

        <h2 class="concept-title">Whitespace</h2>
        <!--http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Span_and_div-->
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>There are Inline and Block elements.   br = break in the line is an Inline element, p = paragraph which is used around the text and is a Block element. Text can be on one or multiple lines and is dependent on which type of tag is used.</p><b>Inline:</b> &lt;br&gt;, &lt;em&gt; <em>(italic)</em>, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;<br><b>Block:</b> &lt;span&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;div&gt;, &lt;form&gt;<br><b>Container Elements:</b> store stuff inside them<br><p> &lt;Span&gt; represents an inline element.  Span is like words within a sentence. <span>All text remains in one line.</span> But when changed to div the content is now block.</p>

        <h2 class="concept-title">Structure of an HTML Document</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>An HTML Document has a basic structure with a head which includes the meta-data, java script, css and title.  The body of the document contains all the data and images, what is considered the insteresting stuff, the contents of the document. These two sections are found within the opening and closing html tags.</p>
          <div class="image"><img src="images/html-structure.jpg" alt="html structure">
          </div>
          <p>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;  designates what kind of HTML is used and is listed before the opening html.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class= "lesson">
      <h2>Lesson 2: Create a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">HTML, CSS and Java</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>HTML is the structure; syntax, rules of the page.  CSS is the style, how it looks. Java is the interactive components.  HTML controls the structure of a page using DOM, a tree like structure.  HTML files are like the structure of a house.  When looking at the structure you are determining where the walls go, what size are the rooms, where does the kitchen go?  CSS is the style of the document, how things look. In the house example this would be the pictures on the wall, colors of the floor and walls.  Java script files are interactive components like a garage door opener and tv remote.  These change some element of your house.</p><p>There are rules for how a website behaves and many web tools to help you build websites. For example Wikipedia's inner structure can be viewed using Google Chrome. DevTools shows the structure of the page as the browser interprets it. Every element in a structure is a rectangle.  If you go deep enough into a structure you will find the same data that is on the web page. the sideways triangle is an html element that could be text or another element. Web pages include images and text.</p><p>The style panel is on the right. When a line on the left side is selected the CSS style is presented on the right. The web browser knows how to display the the HTML file, data, and images by following the syntax and rules of the DOM</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">DOM</h2>
        <!--http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model-->
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>“DOM” (document object model) is the tree-like structure of a web page, a branching structure.  DOM is a standard convention for representing or interacting with objects in HTML. HTML is made up of tags in elements which make up the tree.  These elements are nested creating the branches. This is how HTML classifies page contents, tells the browser which part is text or image.</p><p>To tie structure and style together the HTML document can provide the browser with info on what style to use and where to get it.  There are specific rules for how these elements work. To define style use the CSS <em>Cascading Style Sheet</em> language.  CSS allows you to use a specific syntax and rules to change how the text looks on the web, the borders, position, font etc.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Boxes, Boxes Everywhere</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>In the shapes demo, right click on a web page>inspect element to view the HTML and CSS.  Everything is in rectangles.  If you uncheck the border radius circles become a square.</p><p>“Boxify” your design. Start with big boxes.  Don’t worry about the text or images initially, work from big to small.  From the boxes create HTML.  Example used was My Favorite Apps, with an image and text.  Class attributes are labels on boxes that remind you of what is inside. These can have several labels.  Use descriptive labels to help remind you of what the box is for.  For instance the top box could be “title”.</p>

      <h2>Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h2>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Style</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>The structure created by My App (example in class) does not include style.  Add &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;, then add &lt;html&gt; to indicate we are using html.  Add &lt;head&gt; to add style &lt;link rel=”stylesheet” type=”text/css” href=”style.css”&gt; then close tag for the &lt;/head&gt;.  The &lt;body&gt; tags include the code right before the end of lesson 2 for My App.  Now add style to the style.css file.  “.description {color:red;}”. Save the file and refresh browser.  You will see that the text in the description box turned red.</p><p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Cascading means the most specific rule is applied to control the style of HTML documents.  The rule that best describes the element is used.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Avoid Repetition</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>Avoiding Repetition is important to maintain consistency throughout the HTML file.  The style can more easily be maintained and fewer errors are made.  Repetition can also make editing difficult. 
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Inheritance</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>Inheritance is where the key feature in CSS properties are applied to an element and all its descendants.  Text related properties such as color, font, letter/line spacing (and others) can be inherited, but not box related properties such as background, border, display, float & clear.  Inheritance prevents repetition, and allows developers to write less CSS.  Also enhances faster loading of web pages and clients save money on bandwidth.</p><p>Instead of memorizing all attributes and tags utilize the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">CSS Reference Tool</a> which lists styles of HTML elements. To reduce repetition a rule can be setup to apply to every h1 element for example, or to a class. CSS can also be included in the head of your HTML, this is good for small projects.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Separate CSS File</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>For larger projects link the HTML file to a separate CSS file.  HTML is the main.html file, CSS is the main.css file.  Add a &lt;head&gt; tag to the top of the HTML then add a &lt;link&gt; tag inside the &lt;head&gt; element. Reminder: Link is a void tag: there is no closing tag needed.  Add the following attributes to &lt;link&gt;</p><p><b>ref</b> = <em>"stylesheet"</em><br><b>type</b>= <em>"text/css"</em><br><b>href</b>= <em>"main.css"</em><br></p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">The Box Model</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>HTML elements are boxes and each box has four components: margin, border, padding and content.  Summing up the last three; border, padding and content make up the element width. Margin is not included.  'box-size:border-box' css code creates the calculation of the border size or set size of the border.</p><p>It can be difficult to get the box sizes just right. There are two techniques to help with sizing issues:</p>1. Use a percentage instead of pixels for size.<br> 2. Set box sizing attribute to border-box for every element<br><p>Add browser specific prefixes before style definition.  The size of the boxes are set in pixels.  These can also be done in percentages.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Box Positioning</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>Flex-box layout is an efficient way to layout space in a container or box. Because divs are block elements they take up the entire width of the page by default.  By adding the flex rule display CSS will override this behavior and let the divs appear next to each other.  In the My App example the image is up against the left border and text directly to the right due to flex-box.</p>     
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Code, Test, Refine</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>To begin get a structure of the design and visually 'boxify' the page.  Create tags and headings, size the boxes, and position everything on the screen. Once a general layout is complete then begin working on the smaller details.</p><p>Divide and conquer, look for natural boxes.  Look for repeated styles and semantic elements then begin writing your HTML.  Apply styles, again big to small, then go back and fix any problems.  Developer tools are extremely helpful, allowing the developer to change things on the fly.  Make sure the mockup looks the same as the finished product. Look at the margin size and get as close to the mockup as possible.</p><p> Validation of code can be done using the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input" target="_blank">Markup Validation Service</a> and <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input" target="_blank">CSS Validation Service</a>. These services will check the code for errors and provide warnings.

        <div class= "concept-description"><p>Computer science includes solving problems by breaking them into smaller pieces then describing the sequence of steps to solve each piece and those steps can be executed by a computer to get the best result for the given query.</p><p>There are three pieces to a search engine: find the data, build an index and rank pages. Find data is done by crawling web pages.  The index is built to respond quickly to search queries and rank pages to get the best results for a given query.</p>

        <div class= "concept-description"><p><b>Programs</b><br>Computer programs follow instructions. Examples would include web browsers, Python interpreter, an application on your phone, code written to complete a specific task like print "hello". Web Crawler searches the World Wide Web and produces a list of web pages, starting with a seed page, a link which is really a special kind of text on that web page. Within a web page are more links to more pages, and this continues building a collection of data.</p><p><b>Programming</b><br>Python is a high level language.  The Python program is an interpreter that runs programs and interprets them.  Programming is the core of computer sciences.  Most computers are built to do one thing but without programming a computer cannot do anything.  Computers <b>CAN</b> be programmed to do anything you can imagine by following a precise sequence of steps.  The program provides a precise set of steps which tells the computer exactly what to do.</p><p><b>Interpreter vs Compiler</b><br>A compiler does all the work first then runs the program.

      <div class= "concept">
        <h2 class="concept-title">Variables</h2>
        <div class= "concept-description"><p>Variables make programs simpler to understand.  The program uses the same expression changing the value of the variable to compute different things.  This is much simpler than searching thru the code for each instance. Programmers create a name and use that name to refer to a variable, this is called an assignment statement: Name = Expression.  An expression is assigned to a name using an assignment statement.  The same expression can have different meanings at different times depending on when it is evaluated.  A name can be any sequence of letters and numbers as long as it starts with a letter or underscore.</p><p>Variables are useful because they are easy to remember thus improving code readability, their values are easily changed and variables are a simple way to store values.</p>

          <div class= "concept-description"><p>Structured data is organized in a fixed field. A string or list is structured data. Strings are a sequence of variables like a name or word.  A list is a sequence of anything, letters, words, numbers or characters.  Lists are more powerful than strings.</p><p>Nested Lists are lists within lists, for example mixed_up['apple',3,'oranges',2,['alpha','beta']].  ['alpha','beta'] is nested within the mixed_up list.</p>

          <h2 class="concept-title">What is Object Oriented Programming?</h2>
          <div class= "concept-description"><p>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming language that is based on objects which can be applied in a modular fashion. Objects are data structures that contain data.  A programmer is able to manipulate objects and identify how they relate to each other.  They are arranged in a hierarchy where a single object can be used in many different but related ways. One example is the fish vs salmon lesson.  Salmon is an object (or instance) of the class fish. There are many types of fish, salmon is just one type. A specific fish, Mary, is an object as well; Mary is an object of the class salmon.</p><p>Instances are also known as objects.  An object is one instance of a class. Each distinct logic sequence, or programmed procedure, is known as a method.  There can be more than one method per object or class.  And each method only has access to the data within it's object.</p><p>OOP uses modules which contain definitions and statements.  There are built-in modules that can be imported and used in Python. The Python Standard Library is a great source for modules and their definitions as well as other aspects related to Python. Another source of information for Python programmers is the Google Python Style Guide which lists language and style rules.</p>

        <div class= "concept">
          <h2 class="concept-title">OOP is a Valuable Tool</h2>
          <div class= "concept-description"><p>OOP is diverse, it provides countless way to manipulate objects. Inheritance allows for reduced repetition in programming. Objects make for simpler programming with the ability to break the program into smaller, more manageable pieces. Security is enhanced with OOP by placing data where it is not easily accessible by the rest of the system.  Also, changes made to one object will not impact another.</p>

        <div class= "concept">
          <h2 class="concept-title">Connections Made to Abstract Thinking</h2>
          <div class= "concept-description"><p>Abstract thinking is relational, being able to think about attributes and relationships separate from the objects that have those attributes or share those relationships. Object Oriented Programming uses relationships and attributes of items. HTML and CSS do the same.  This type of thinking opens up the opportunity to group data in a way that reduces code by reusing it for similar classes, concepts, etc.</p><p>An example could be how you divide or group people.  They could be divided or grouped by age, hair color, home town, or shoe size. There are endless opportunities for relating data.  Object Oriented Programming provides a hierarchical method to organize and relate data into manageable chunks of data in a way that allows for safe and easy access.</p>

The message sent is a GET message in the form of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator).  The URL is made up of the protocol, host and path. HTTP is the protocol, www.cnn.com is a host and / is the path (another example would be /money).  The server accepts the message and runs some code. The server then responds with the contents of the requested object.</p><p>The request from your browser begins with a request line.  The request line includes the method (type of request - most common are GET and POST), path - the actual document being requested, and version of HTTP.  Since you are already connected to the host, which indicates where we are.  The path is used for making the request.</p>

Validation is a confirmation on the server side that we received what we expected to see.  Input validation will improve a site's security. Escape is used to prevent unauthorized access by entering random text or code to alter a program. Using the escape functionality can also avoid promblems with a page that could make for a poor user experience. If the user was unable to link to the page, share or recieves an empty form.  An error may require the user to reload the page in order to resubmit a form.  These can be managed thru validation and proper coding.  A redirect would make for a nicer user experience.</p>

This is the art of abstraction, creating models that are re-used so no rewriting is necessary.  The html templates in this course were designed to request data from the user which was then rendered in Python.</p><p>Templates inheritance allows you to have one template that includes your header and footer and sub-templates that contain the content.

        <h2>Lesson 1: Introduction to Javascript</h2>
        <div class= "concept">
          <h2 class="concept-title">What is Javascript</h2>
          <div class= "concept-description"><p>Javascript is a progrmming language that is used to make web pages interactive. It is a way to impact elements within HTML.  The Javascript Basics class introduced the console for a quick check of the code.  This section made me aware how many programming languages have a similar structure/format making learning each a little simpler; for instance defining variables (var in JS vs def in Python), the use of arrays, if or while loops.  Data can be manipulated in Javascript just like we did in the Resume Builder of the Javascript course.  Animation can be added, resizing of pictures, movement, interaction with the user through buttons and mouse clicks just to name a few.  Javascript seems to be limited only by your imagination.  While I am not a very creative person, I very much enjoyed building my little city that can be seen at the bottom of this webpage.  It shows off a few of the capabilities of Javascript including CSS styling inside the script tags, animation of the car, more about functions, animation or draw loops, elements, class id and a how to draw shapes.  Almost felt like a child building my first Legos city, lots of missteps but absolute joy when I saw the car cross the screen on my webpage for the first time.</p>

          <h2 class="concept-title">JavaScript Basics - Build a Resume</h2>
          <div class= "concept-description"><p>Resumes are not fun to create but in this case it was a great way to start learning Javascript.  Mine can be viewed <a href ="https://github.com/ablomberg1/frontend-nanodegree-resume.git"> here</a> in Github </p><p>Included in the resume is the option to change my name to an international standard of having the last name appear in all capital letters.  There is a button that allows the user to make the change.  Another cool piece is the map which highlights all the cities I have worked and lived in that were included in my resume.  Google Map is used and the functionality of zooming in, out and panning all directions is carried onto the resume.</p><p>Some key learning points in the class were that JavaScript can be added to HTML within a script opening and closing tag. JS best practice is to create a separate file for JS, like python, and attach the file to your HTML with script tags in the header referencing the file path. A function is created and called in HTML.  The funciton may include for loops with a variable that iterates at a set interval until it reaches the determined number.  If and else statements are useful.  Replace(), prepend(), and append() are used to place the data or picture in a specific place on your web page.  The console.log is a great developer tool for getting a quick look at errors, a basic print method.  The semi colon is used to signal the end of a statement.Arrays can be created, they are just like lists and are zero indexed.  String.slice separates characters of a string, array.pop returns the last element of the array, array.push method adds an element to the end of an array.  There are no classes in JS, there are objects. Using dot or bracket notation you can declare an object then use a dot or brackets around the string to define the properties.  There is more but I will end with DOM Manipulation method getElementById will grap a single page elemnt object with the id given.</p><br> Reference: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud804/l-1946788554/e-3471338563/m-2288608556"> JavaScript Basics</a>

          <div class= "concept-description"><p>I completed the Udacity Javacript class but wanted to learn about the animation and understand more about how to create a js file that was captured in my HTML. To this end I took the KhanAcademy Javascript course and most of the HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive course.  Between the two I learned more about how to find and update DOM elements by tag, class, or CSS selector; that drawing type elements like rect, triangle, arc are viewable on a web page when utilizing processingjs and canvas. How to use event listener with mouse strokes in Javascript, mouseX and mouseY, to track what users click on or allow the user to draw on the page. Mathmatical operators can be used in js. I used some in an attempt to stay away from 'majic numbers'. This seemed more confusing in some cases to have so many fractions of or multiples of a variable when working on the code. So I need to learn more about better ways to get around the 'majic'.  For now the code looks messy  (in my opinion), although I do understand the idea behind using variables to make updates simpler.</p><p>Processing.js makes it possible to include animation created in Javascript on a webpage like this one.  It was as simple as downloading the processing.js file, accessing it in the HTML head section, defining the global variables, create a draw function in js which includes the animation, and pass the function in the HTML script tag.</p><br>References: <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js"> khanacademy.org/html-css-js</a> and <a "https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming"> khanacademy.org/Intro to JS</a></div>
